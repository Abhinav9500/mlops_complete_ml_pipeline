Building Pipeline:
1. Create a Github repo and clone it in local(Add experiments).
2. Add src folder along with all components (run tge individually)
3. Add data, models, reports derectories to .gitignore file
4. Now git add, commit, push

setting up dvc piepline (without param)
5. Create dvc.yaml file and add stages to it.
6. dvc init then do dvc repro to test the pipeline automation.(check dvc dag)
7. now git add , commit, push

### I have already done the below work with params file .yaml , i am just writing it down and will try to do it again.

8. add params.yaml file
9. Add the params setup (mentioned below)
10. Do 'dvc repro' again to  test the pipeline along with the params
11. Now git add, commit, push


Experiments with dvc
12. pip install dvdlive
13. add the dvclive code  block
14. do "dvc exp run' it will create a new dvc.yaml (if already not there) and dvclive directory (each run will be considrered as an exp)
15. do 'dvc exp show' on terminal to see the experiemnts or use extension on vscode <install dvc extension>
16. do 'dvc exp remove (exp-name)' to remove exp (optional) | 'dvc exp apply (exp-name)' to reproduce exp
17. change params ,rerun code (produce new experiemnts)
18. now git add, commit, push
